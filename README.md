# PythOS
PythOS is an entire OS with architecture designed to run in the most restrictive on environments on just a fresh install of Python.
# What's up with the version?
Currently PythOS has the version -1.0.0. I'm aware this breaks convention, however it's currently very unstable. Once I work out a lot of the problems, I'll push it to Github and update the version to 0.0.0.
# What about older versions of Python?
There is going to be a Python 2.7 compatible version of PythOS at some point in the future once version 0.0.0 is released.
